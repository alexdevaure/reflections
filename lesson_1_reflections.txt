How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see a bug
that was introduced?
By being focused only on the changes.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?
I can roll back or compare any version to the last one.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving
multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file
separately?
Because they can control projects that can be in different projects whereas
others are just in a file.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
use git log to know which commits to compare and the git diff to compare them.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
We always start from a working version and we can roll back if needed.
